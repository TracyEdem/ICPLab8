In coming up with my solution for the linearization function, I created a for loop to dereference the array A for the given indexes, and store the resulting value in a variable value. I then traversed array B and compared the values to that of the number stored in value. If it returns true, the index of that location is then printed out.
The formula I used in computing (i,j)=F^-1(I) is C[i][j] = B[i*N+j]. And for filling B[I], I just used a loop.
